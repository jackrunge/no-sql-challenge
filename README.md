<h1> Introduction </h1>

* This repository holds two jupyter notebooks that evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles in the UK. <br>
* All the files here were completed for the module 12 challenge for the DU Data Analytics Bootcamp. <br>
* All of the data used was provided by edX and is located in the resources folder, and I adapted the code and markdown notes provided by edX.
